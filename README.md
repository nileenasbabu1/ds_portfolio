This is my data science portfolio on generic projects


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a full stack data science professional with cloud computing skills of more than 12 years of relevant experience. My skills range from data wrangling, data analysis, visualization (using power BI, tableau, python), model building, LLM, GenAI.....
### Project 1: NLP Safety Assurance Chatbot

##### One of the Biggest challenges for Mining/Metal industries are to save their employees from Accidents/Injuries in workplace. Unfortunately, sometimes employees also die in such environment. Using AI techniques, we can help the professionals to highlight the safety risk as per the incident description.

### Project 3: Sarcasm Detection

##### News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection

[][https://github.com/nileenasbabu1/sarcasm_detection]
### Project 4: Sentiments Classification

##### The objective of this project is to build a text classification model that analyses the customer's sentiments based on their reviews in the IMDB database. The model uses a complex deep learning model to build an embedding layer followed by a classification algorithm to analyze the sentiment of the customers

### Project 6: Face Mask Segmentation

##### Advanced Computer Vision - Face Mask Prediction using U-Net

[https://github.com/nileenasbabu1/face_mask_segmentation]
### Project 7: Movie Recommendation Systems

##### To make a recommendation system that recommends at least five(5)new products based on the user's habits
